Customer Satisfaction Analysis is the process of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data regarding how satisfied customers are with a company’s products, services, and overall experience. If you want to learn how to analyze the satisfaction of customers with a business and how to make further decisions based on satisfaction levels, this article is for you. In this article, I’ll take you through the task of Customer Satisfaction Analysis with Python.

Customer Satisfaction Analysis: Overview
Customer Satisfaction Analysis involves collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data on customer experiences and perceptions through surveys, feedback forms, ratings, and reviews. By identifying key drivers of satisfaction and dissatisfaction, businesses can make informed decisions to improve products, services, and customer interactions.

It helps retain customers, boost loyalty and advocacy, drive sales growth, and gain a competitive edge, which ultimately enhances overall business performance and customer experience.

To get started with the task of Customer Satisfaction Analysis, we need a dataset based on customer satisfaction and feedback. I found an ideal dataset for this task, which contains features like:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Age: Age of the customer.
Gender: Gender of the customer (Male/Female).
PurchaseAmount: Total amount spent by the customer.
PurchaseFrequency: Number of purchases made by the customer.
ProductQualityRating: Customer rating for product quality (1-5).
DeliveryTimeRating: Customer rating for delivery time (1-5).
CustomerServiceRating: Customer rating for customer service (1-5).
WebsiteEaseOfUseRating: Customer rating for website ease of use (1-5).
ReturnRate: Proportion of products returned by the customer.
DiscountUsage: Amount of discount used by the customer.
LoyaltyProgramMember: Whether the customer is a loyalty program member (Yes/No).

Now, let’s get started with the task of Customer Satisfaction Analysis by importing the necessary Python libraries and the dataset:

1. <h6>import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv("/content/E-commerce_NPA_Dataset.csv")

print(data.head())</h6>
